# MODIFICATIONS
# -------------

# NOTES
# -----

# This script has to be run with an Admin account that has Admin rights to the remote systems.
# There will be a lot of Red text at the end of the script due to failed access to systems hard drive when pulling profiles, it can be ignored.

# CHANGES
# -------

# Text file with the list of computers to run against
$Computers = Get-Content "C:\work\TEST.txt"

# Save path for the results
$Date = Get-Date -UFormat "%d-%b-%g %H%M"
$Path = "C:\work\Systems_Last_Logon_$Date.csv"

# Max number of Jobs to run at one time (60 was found to be the sweet spot)
$MaxThreads = 200

# Number of seconds before the script cancles and hung up jobs (for a small number of computers it can be reduced to ~30)
$TimeOut = 150

# SCRIPT BEGINS
